# AGENTS.md — quotey

This file was generated by `acfs newproj` as a starting template.

If you used the interactive wizard, toolchain and Docker workflow sections
may be included based on detected tech stack. In CLI mode, this template is
generic - edit or add sections as needed.

To regenerate with different options, move this file aside and re-run:
  acfs newproj --interactive

## RULE 1 – ABSOLUTE (DO NOT EVER VIOLATE THIS)

You may NOT delete any file or directory unless I explicitly give the exact command **in this session**.

- This includes files you just created (tests, tmp files, scripts, etc.).
- You do not get to decide that something is "safe" to remove.
- If you think something should be removed, stop and ask. You must receive clear written approval **before** any deletion command is even proposed.

Treat "never delete files without permission" as a hard invariant.

---

## IRREVERSIBLE GIT & FILESYSTEM ACTIONS

Absolutely forbidden unless I give the **exact command and explicit approval** in the same message:

- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`
- `rm -rf`
- Any command that can delete or overwrite code/data

Rules:

1. If you are not 100% sure what a command will delete, do not propose or run it. Ask first.
2. Prefer safe tools: `git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups, etc.
3. After approval, restate the command verbatim, list what it will affect, and wait for confirmation.
4. When a destructive command is run, record in your response:
   - The exact user text authorizing it
   - The command run
   - When you ran it

If that audit trail is missing, then you must act as if the operation never happened.

---

## Node / JS Toolchain

- Use **bun** for everything JS/TS.
- ❌ Never use `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.
- Lockfiles: only `bun.lock`. Do not introduce any other lockfile.
- Target **latest Node.js**. No need to support old Node versions.
- **Note:** `bun install -g <pkg>` is valid syntax (alias for `bun add -g`). Do not "fix" it.

## Project Architecture

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Describe your project's architecture here -->

### Components

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: List your project's main components/domains -->

Example structure:
- **A) Backend API** — Framework, database, main responsibilities
- **B) Frontend** — Framework, UI library, key patterns
- **C) Shared** — Common utilities, types, constants

---

## Repo Layout

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Document your actual directory structure -->

```
quotey/
├── README.md
├── AGENTS.md
├── .beads/                        # Issue tracking (br)
├── .claude/                       # Claude Code settings
│
└── src/                           # Your source code
```

---

## Generated Files — NEVER Edit Manually

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: If you have generated files, document them here -->

**Current state:** There are no generated files in this repo.

If/when you add generated artifacts:
- **Rule:** Never hand-edit generated outputs.
- **Convention:** Put generated outputs in a clearly labeled directory and document the generator command.

---

## Code Editing Discipline

- Do **not** run scripts that bulk-modify code (codemods, invented one-off scripts, giant `sed`/regex refactors).
- Large mechanical changes: break into smaller, explicit edits and review diffs.
- Subtle/complex changes: edit by hand, file-by-file, with careful reasoning.

---

## Backwards Compatibility & File Sprawl

We optimize for a clean architecture now, not backwards compatibility.

- No "compat shims" or "v2" file clones.
- When changing behavior, migrate callers and remove old code.
- New files are only for genuinely new domains that don't fit existing modules.
- The bar for adding files is very high.

---

## Console Output

- Prefer **structured, minimal logs** (avoid spammy debug output).
- Treat user-facing UX as UI-first; logs are for operators/debugging.

---

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

Agent Mail is available as an MCP server for coordinating work across agents.

What Agent Mail gives:
- Identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads.
- Advisory file reservations (leases) to avoid agents clobbering each other.
- Persistent artifacts in git (human-auditable).

Core patterns:

1. **Same repo**
   - Register identity:
     - `ensure_project` then `register_agent` with the repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before editing:
     - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`.
   - Communicate:
     - `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`.
     - `fetch_inbox`, then `acknowledge_message`.
   - Fast reads:
     - `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20`.
     - `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.

2. **Macros vs granular:**
   - Prefer macros when speed is more important than fine-grained control:
     - `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
   - Use granular tools when you need explicit behavior.

Common pitfalls:
- "from_agent not registered" → call `register_agent` with correct `project_key`.
- `FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT` → adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   br sync --flush-only
   git add .beads/
   git commit -m "Update beads"
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

---

## Issue Tracking with br (Beads)

All issue tracking goes through **Beads**. No other TODO systems.

Key invariants:

- `.beads/` is authoritative state and **must always be committed** with code changes.
- Do not edit `.beads/*.jsonl` directly; only via `br`.

### Basics

Check ready work:

```bash
br ready --json
```

Create issues:

```bash
br create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
br create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:br-123 --json
```

Update:

```bash
br update br-42 --status in_progress --json
br update br-42 --priority 1 --json
```

Complete:

```bash
br close br-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

Types: `bug`, `feature`, `task`, `epic`, `chore`

Priorities: `0` critical, `1` high, `2` medium (default), `3` low, `4` backlog

Agent workflow:

1. `br ready` to find unblocked work.
2. Claim: `br update <id> --status in_progress`.
3. Implement + test.
4. If you discover new work, create a new bead with `discovered-from:<parent-id>`.
5. Close when done.
6. Commit `.beads/` in the same commit as code changes.

Never:
- Use markdown TODO lists.
- Use other trackers.
- Duplicate tracking.

## Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects. Use robot flags for deterministic outputs.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Just the single top pick + claim command
bv --robot-plan          # Parallel execution tracks
bv --robot-insights      # Full graph metrics
```

Use bv instead of parsing beads.jsonl—it computes PageRank, critical paths, cycles, and parallel tracks deterministically.

## cass — Cross-Agent Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations so we can reuse solved problems.

**Rules:** Never run bare `cass` (TUI). Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

```bash
cass health
cass search "authentication error" --robot --limit 5
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json
```

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.

---

## Memory System: cass-memory

Before starting complex tasks, retrieve relevant context:

```bash
cm context "<task description>" --json
```

This returns:
- **relevantBullets**: Rules that may help with your task
- **antiPatterns**: Pitfalls to avoid
- **historySnippets**: Past sessions that solved similar problems

Protocol:
1. **START**: Run `cm context "<task>" --json` before non-trivial work
2. **WORK**: Reference rule IDs when following them
3. **END**: Just finish your work. Learning happens automatically.

---

## UBS Quick Reference

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

```bash
ubs file.ts file2.py                    # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs .                                   # Whole project
```

**Speed Critical:** Scope to changed files. `ubs src/file.ts` (< 1s) vs `ubs .` (30s).

**Bug Severity:**
- **Critical** (always fix): Null safety, XSS/injection, async/await, memory leaks
- **Important** (production): Type narrowing, division-by-zero, resource leaks
- **Contextual** (judgment): TODO/FIXME, console logs
