Summary of findings (2-3 pages)\n2. Clear recommendations with trade-offs\n3. List of \"gotchas\" or pitfalls to avoid\n4. Decision record (if architectural impact)\n5. Implementation notes (if applicable)\n\n## Relationship to Implementation\n\nResearch tasks can run PARALLEL to foundation implementation but must complete BEFORE features that depend on them:\n\n- SQLite research → Before Deal DNA similarity queries\n- Slack research → Before production deployment\n- Constraint research → Before CPQ core implementation\n- LLM research → Before Agent runtime\n- Security research → Before handling real customer data\n\n## Research Tasks\n\n1.

{"id":"bd-70d","title":"EPIC: Quotey AI-Native CPQ Enhancement Initiative","description":"# EPIC: Quotey AI-Native CPQ Enhancement Initiative\n\n## Vision & Strategic Context\n\nThis epic represents a fundamental evolution of Quotey from a deterministic CPQ tool into an **AI-native, intelligence-driven quoting platform** that operates at the speed of conversation while maintaining absolute determinism for pricing and policy decisions.\n\n### Why This Matters Now\n\nTraditional CPQ systems are form-heavy, approval-slow, and knowledge-siloed. Sales reps spend 30%+ of their time on administrative quote activities rather than selling. This initiative changes the game by:\n\n1. **Meeting users where they work** (Slack-native, conversation-first)\n2. **Surfacing tribal knowledge automatically** (Deal DNA, past outcomes)\n3. **Removing friction from approvals** (emoji micro-approvals, smart routing)\n4. **Making the system explainable** (policy reasoning in plain English)\n5. **Ensuring trust through cryptographic integrity** (immutable audit trails)\n\n### Core Architectural Principles\n\nThese features share DNA that honors Quotey's foundational safety principle:\n\n- **Deterministic Reliability**: LLMs translate, predict, and explain—but NEVER decide prices, validity, or policy\n- **AI-Powered UX**: Natural language, prediction, proactive assistance\n- **Slack-Native Velocity**: Every feature optimized for thread-based collaboration\n- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core CPQ works without AI; AI makes it faster/smarter\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n- Quote creation time: 50% reduction\n- Approval cycle time: 70% reduction  \n- Sales rep satisfaction: NPS > 50\n- Quote accuracy: 99.5%+ (zero AI-induced pricing errors)\n- System adoption: 90%+ daily active usage\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\nThis epic decomposes into 10 major feature areas, each with granular sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Deal DNA** - Configuration fingerprinting for intelligent similarity matching\n2. **Conversational Solver** - Natural language constraint resolution\n3. **Emoji Micro-Approvals** - Frictionless approval workflows\n4. **Ghost Quotes** - Predictive opportunity creation from buying signals\n5. **Explainable Policy Engine** - Transparent reasoning for all decisions\n6. **Live Multi-User Sessions** - Real-time collaborative quote editing\n7. **Win Probability Pricing** - Data-informed pricing optimization\n8. **Immutable Quote Ledger** - Cryptographic integrity guarantees\n9. **Configuration Archaeology** - Natural language forensics for constraints\n10. **Smart Thread Routing** - Authority-aware automatic routing\n\n### Technical Foundation\n\nAll features build on Quotey's existing stack:\n- Rust backend with SQLx migrations\n- SQLite with vector extensions (planned)\n- Slack Socket Mode + Block Kit\n- Deterministic rule engine (unchanged)\n\n### Quality Gates\n\nFor ALL stories in this epic:\n- `cargo check` - Type checking and compilation\n- `cargo clippy` - Linting\n- `cargo test` - Unit tests pass\n- SQLx migrations must be reversible\n- No AI in critical path of pricing/policy decisions","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-23T11:02:31.214933450Z","created_by":"ubuntuman","updated_at":"2026-02-23T11:32:03.519710844Z","external_ref":"agents:brainstorming-session-2026-02-23","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-70d","depends_on_id":"bd-3d8.10","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-23T11:32:03.519648587Z","created_by":"ubuntuman","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}
{"id":"bd-70d.1","title":"FEAT-01: Deal DNA - Configuration Fingerprint Matching","description":"# FEAT-01: Deal DNA - Configuration Fingerprint Matching\n\n## Feature Overview\n\nDeal DNA provides **intelligent similarity matching** for quotes by generating mathematical fingerprints of every configuration. When a rep builds a quote, the system instantly surfaces 3-5 most similar past deals with their outcomes, pricing, and customer profiles.\n\n### The Problem This Solves\n\nSales reps operate in isolation. They don't know:\n- \"What did we charge similar customers?\"\n- \"What configs closed successfully for this use case?\"\n- \"What's the market-tested discount for this segment?\"\n\nTribal knowledge walks out the door when reps leave. Deal DNA captures it permanently.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Fingerprint Generation**: Every finalized quote gets a MinHash/simhash fingerprint of its configuration\n2. **Vector Storage**: Fingerprints stored with outcome metadata (won/lost, final price, close time)\n3. **Similarity Query**: New quotes query for nearest neighbors in fingerprint space\n4. **Contextual Presentation**: Results shown with relevance scores and outcome summaries\n\n### User Experience\n\n**Slack Thread Flow:**\n```\nRep: \"Building quote for Acme Corp, Enterprise tier + Premium Support + API access\"\nQuotey: [Shows quote preview with Deal DNA card]\n        \"Similar deals closed at $45-52k with 15-20% discounts\"\n        \"3 of 5 similar deals won (60% win rate)\"\n        \"Average sales cycle: 34 days\"\n```\n\n### Technical Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│  Quote Service  │────▶│ Fingerprint      │────▶│  Vector Store   │\n│                 │     │ Generator        │     │  (SQLite +      │\n└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     │   extensions)   │\n         │                                         └─────────────────┘\n         │                                                   ▲\n         │              ┌──────────────────┐                   │\n         └─────────────▶│ Similarity       │───────────────────┘\n                        │ Query Engine     │\n                        └──────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Data Model Additions\n\n- `configuration_fingerprints` table: hash, vector representation, quote reference\n- `similarity_indices` table: precomputed similarity scores for fast lookup\n- `deal_outcomes` table: win/loss, final terms, close date\n\n### Integration Points\n\n- Quote finalization trigger (auto-generate fingerprint)\n- Quote retrieval (fetch similar deals)\n- Slack Block Kit rendering (similarity card)\n- Analytics dashboard (aggregate patterns)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Fingerprints generate deterministically for identical configs\n- [ ] Similarity queries return results in <100ms\n- [ ] Results include at least: price range, discount range, win rate\n- [ ] Integration with existing quote workflow (no extra steps)\n- [ ] `cargo check` passes\n- [ ] `cargo clippy` passes\n- [ ] `cargo test` passes\n- [ ] Migration is reversible","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-23T11:02:42.241808630Z","created_by":"ubuntuman","updated_at":"2026-02-23T11:31:49.879972061Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-70d.1","depends_on_id":"bd-3d8.10","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-23T11:31:49.879896679Z","created_by":"ubuntuman","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"bd-70d.1","depends_on_id":"bd-70d","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-23T11:02:42.241808630Z","created_by":"ubuntuman","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}

The system captures this as valid approval with full audit trail.\n\n### The Problem This Solves\n\nApproval workflows kill deal velocity:\n- Reps wait hours/days for email responses\n- Approvers don't want to log into another system\n- Urgent deals stall over $5k exceptions\n- Audit trails are manual and error-prone\n\nEmoji approvals meet approvers where they already are (Slack) with zero friction.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Exception Detection**: System detects discount/config exceeds thresholds\n2. **Smart Routing**: @mentions correct approver with context\n3. **Emoji Response**: Approver taps 👍 (approve), 👎 (reject), or 💬 (discuss)\n4. **Instant Capture**: Reaction logged as formal approval with cryptographic audit\n5. **Thread Update**: Quote automatically advances to next stage\n\n### User Experience\n\n**Slack Thread Flow:**\n```\nQuotey: \"@sarah-vp-sales This quote needs VP approval:\n        • Customer: Acme Corp (strategic account)\n        • Value: $67k ARR\n        • Discount: 23% (threshold: 20%)\n        • Term: 2-year commitment\n        \n        👍 to approve | 👎 to reject | 💬 to discuss\"\n\n[Sarah taps 👍 within 30 seconds]\n\nQuotey: \"✅ Approved by @sarah-vp-sales at 2:34pm\n        Quote advancing to finalization...\"\n```\n\n### Technical Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│  Slack Emoji    │────▶│ Reaction         │────▶│  Approval       │\n│  Event          │     │ Handler          │     │  Validator      │\n└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘\n         │                                                   │\n         ▼                                                   ▼\n┌─────────────────┐                              ┌─────────────────┐\n│  Audit Logger   │                              │  Quote State    │\n│  (Immutable)    │                              │  Machine        │\n└─────────────────┘                              └─────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Components\n\n- **Reaction Handler**: Process Slack emoji reaction events\n- **Authority Validator**: Verify reactor has approval authority for this exception type\n- **Approval State Machine**: Transition quote based on valid approval\n- **Audit Logger**: Cryptographically-signed approval record\n\n### Security & Compliance\n\n- Emoji only valid from authorized approvers\n- Reaction timestamp + user ID + message ID captured\n- Immutable audit trail (hash chain)\n- Reversible within 5 minutes (misclick protection)\n\n### Integration Points\n\n- Slack Events API (reaction_added)\n- Existing approval workflow engine\n- Immutable ledger (Feature 08)\n- Notification system\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 👍 from authorized approver = valid approval\n- [ ] Unauthorized emoji reactions ignored with DM warning\n- [ ] Approval logged with: who, what, when, context\n- [ ] Quote state advances automatically on approval\n- [ ] 5-minute undo window for misclicks\n- [ ] `cargo check` passes\n- [ ] `cargo clippy` passes\n- [ ] `cargo test` passes","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-23T11:03:00.046934541Z","created_by":"ubuntuman","updated_at":"2026-02-23T11:31:49.417802635Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-70d.3","depends_on_id":"bd-3d8.10","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-23T11:31:49.417740549Z","created_by":"ubuntuman","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"bd-70d.3","depends_on_id":"bd-70d","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-23T11:03:00.046934541Z","created_by":"ubuntuman","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}
